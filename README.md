# Medify — basic UI

This repository contains a simple static UI prototype for Medify: a small dashboard with pages for Prescriptions, Tracker and Files.

What I propose in this PR
- Responsive layout, improved typography and color variables
- Accessible hamburger navigation and dark-mode toggle (persisted)
- JS sample rendering on Prescription and Tracker pages so pages look complete
- Small accessibility improvements and meta tags

How to preview locally
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the HTML files in your browser (index.html, prescription.html, tracker.html) — no build tools required.
3. For a quick static server you can run: `npx http-server .` or `python -m http.server` and open http://localhost:8080
